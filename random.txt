## PRIMES USA

I did math research at MIT PRIMES (USA section) under the mentorship of MIT graduate student Yongyi Chen. My project ``On Generalized Carmichael Numbers'' studied the following problem: for a given integer $k$, what integers $n$ satisfy $a^{n-k+1} \equiv a \pmod{n}$ for all integers $a$?

My findings can be found on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04883).

## Euler Circle

### Research Group

During the summer of 2019, I was part of a research group at Euler Circle under the guidance of Dr. Rubinstein--Salzedo. Our goal was to find an efficient factoring algorithm for primes of specific forms, motivated by Pollard's $p-1$, William's $p+1$, and the more recent Cheng's $4p-1$ algorithms. 

### Expository Papers

By the end of each Euler Circle class, students were expected to have studied and written a short expository paper on a topic related to, but not covered in the class. Below, I've attached a short description for each paper I wrote at Euler Circle.

<details>
<summary> <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/eulercircle/mandelbrot-set.pdf"> mandelbrot-set </a> (Winter 2019) </summary>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Gives an introduction of the Mandelbrot Set and summarizes some interesting results.</li>
<li>Proofs of deeper results are intentionally omitted as they require complex analysis. However, pictures of Mandelbrot Set give a convincing illustration of the theorems.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary> character-sums (Spring 2019) </summary>
<ul>
<li>Introduces the character sum problem and proves increasingly better bounds for the sum.</li>
<li>The main result is the Polya-Vinogradov inequality, which gives a surprisingly strong bound with only elementary techniques. Finally, the paper discusses the motivation for the character sum problem and some better bounds assuming GRH.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary> isogeny-graphs (Fall 2019) </summary>
    + Introduces elliptic curves and their algebraic structure, particularly the graphs generated by isogenies between Elliptic Curves of different j-invariants.
    + The theory on isogeny graphs is used to describe the cryptographic protocol “Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman” which is conjectured to be secure against quantum attacks.
</details>

<details>
<summary> modular-forms (Winter 2020) </summary>
    + Introduces modular forms and discusses important examples, including the Eisenstein series and cusp forms.
    + The main result is section 5: the description of complex elliptic curves using modular forms through their construction from the Weierstrass p-functions and classification using the j-invariant.
    + (co-written with Sarah Fujimori, another Euler Circle student)
</details>

<details>
<summary> constructions (Spring 2020) </summary>
    + Reviews the classical results on compass-and-straightedge constructions. Introduces constructions using conics and restricted constructions. 
    + The main result is the classification of conic constructible points using field theory. 
</details>

<details>
<summary> tropical-ag (Summer 2020) </summary>
    + Introduces tropical arithmetic, tropical polynomials, and finally tropical algebraic geometry, an analogue of classical algebraic geometry on tropical polynomials.
    + The main result is proving the tropical version of Bézout’s theorem using dual subdivisions of Newton polygons.
</details>

<details>
<summary> fixed-points (Summer 2020) </summary>
    + Proves two major fixed-point theorems: Sperner’s Lemma and Brouwer’s fixed point theorem. Showcases their applications in game theory by proving the existence of envy-free cake division and the existence of Nash equilibrium in non-cooperative games.
    + I presented on this topic at SUMaC (Stanford University Mathematics Camp).
</details>

<details>
<summary> iterated-log (Fall 2020) </summary>
    + Motivates and proves Khinchin’s Law of the Iterated Logarithm, a major theorem in probability theory on the maximum fluctuation of a random walk on the integers.
    + Ends with a discussion of stronger versions of Khinchin’s LIL and a generalization for Brownian motion.
