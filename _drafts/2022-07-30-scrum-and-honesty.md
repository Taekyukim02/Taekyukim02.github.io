title:  "Scrum and Honesty"

I recently learned about Scrum at my summer internship at Realtime Robotics. To put it briefly, Scrum is a framework originating in software development designed to enable frequent communication between developers, customers, and product managers. Work is done in 1-4 week chunks called "Sprints" and the product manager is responsible for prioritizing the customers' wants and needs and assigning the developers the work to be done in the newest sprint. 

J. J. Sutherland, a co-creator of Scrum, wrote the book *Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time* that explains other concepts involved Scrum and why they can drastically boost productivity --- with real world examples of success brought by Scrum and failures by the traditional "waterfall" method. 

Today, I want to tell you about just one of the principles of Scrum: honesty. I'll explore this concept from several angles:
  1. Honesty in communication and feedback
  2. Honesty in productivity and reasonble work assignment

## Communication and Feedback

One of the most common pieces of advice I got about internships is to ask for feedback, and for a good reason: an internship is a learning experience first and job second. Yes, I'll be creating something of value for my team, but my growth as an intellectual comes foremost. Thus, it's crucuial that you effectively utilize your main source of feedback at an internship --- your managers and mentors. At school, your mentors may be your research mentors or professors.

If you want to learn as efficiently and quickly as possible, you have to be honest about the signals you send to your mentors. Your successes, your failures, what you're enjoying, what you dislike. Frequent communication with a diverse mix of ups and downs creates openness in your relationship and lowers the stakes for reporting to your mentor. You may want to only show good results to impress your mentor, but this is unproductive. When we share our struggles, you create an opportunity for them to step in with advice, accumulated over years of experience. You're also showing your curiosity to learn when you ask for help. What kind of mentor or employer will dislike you want to be more effective at your job? Though scary at first, asking for help will become easier and become invaluable as it accelerates your learning process.

In addition, you should be curious about things beyond your immediate role (e.g. what other teams are doing, the financials of the company, the demand and supply of the technology they're creating). Doing your assigned job is impressive, but it may be even more impressive when we're curious to learn beyond our immediate responsibilities. 

Mentors are an invaluable resource, able to give you dynamic feedback and guidance as your learning experience progresses. When you feel discouraged and frustrated, they may provide reassurance and encouragement; when you feel excited at reaching a major checkpoint, they can celebrate with you, knowing the struggles you've gone through. And finally, knowing your likes and dislikes of your current role helps them recommend you towards a role that may be a better fit.

## Why Being Realistic is Important

J. J. Sutherland's book supports the idea that great work is created by happy, fulfilled workers who feel autonomy and pride in the work they are producing. To this point, if people are overworked and are pushed to work long hours with unreasonable work expectations, they will not feel satisfied by their work. Always, something will be left on the to-do list no matter how hard they seem to be working.

This was me in high school, and probably now as well. Always pushing myself to do more and more, too many things on my plate at the same time.
