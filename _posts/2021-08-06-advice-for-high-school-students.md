title:  "On Wasted Time"

I originally planned to write about general advice for high school students, but my first point on avoiding wasted time turned into a whole blog. I plan to write about the other points in a later blog post. I hope that someone else will find my advice worthwhile and can learn from my experiences. 


## Wasted Time

### Defining the Problem

How many hours do you spend scrolling on your phone or computer with your brain switched off, not doing anything in particular? Would you say those hours are well-spent? 

I expect that the standard answer will be "No, I wasted time," but I also wouldn't be surprised if someone argued for "Yes" with the idea that scrolling on their phone helps them relax. In that light, I think the concept of "wasting time" is difficult to pin down. A simple activity like Internet surfing can be fun and theraputic activity, but if you surf the Internet for hours upon hours, it's seems pretty safe to say that you wasted those hours. How, and where do we draw the line?

### Inspiration from Economics

Economics partly solves this problem with the idea of an "opportunity cost." Any time you make a decision, the choice you didn't make is the opportunity cost. For example, say we had a choice between two flavors of ice cream: chocolate and strawberry. If you pick the chocolate ice cream, then you lose out on the strawberry ice cream, so the opportunity to eat the strawberry ice cream is your opportunity cost. But you might say "Hey! I can still eat the strawberry ice cream if I get both!" Then, the opportunity cost here would be the doubled cost of two ice cream cones or maybe, "Not being able to have dinner because you ate too much ice cream."

If money isn't a problem and you already know you're going to have a small dinner, then your opportunity cost would be negligibly small, so there's little to no penalty for getting both ice cream cones. But the opportunity cost always exists for any decision you make, including the decision of how you should spend your time.

### Opportunity Cost of Time

If you spend your time doing activity X, then the clear opportunity cost is not being able to do other activities (of course you could try to multitask, but that comes at the cost of splitting your attention and doing a worse job on all of the invovled activities...) Economics doesn't tell us what we should be doing with our time, but it does tell us what we lose if we don't spend it wisely --- time and potential to do other worthwhile things.

Whenever you spend an hour scrolling through social media, you're missing out on an hour to spend with friends and family. Those three hours you spent napping in the afternoon could have been spent learning a new programming language or reading a book.

Now, I'm not telling you to forego social media or afternoon naps, but rather to be mindful of how you're spending your time. Why spend an hour voluntarily doing something you don't enjoy when you can spend that time doing something fulfilling (like learning a new skill) or at least something fun (like hanging out with friends or playing a fun game). 

With that all said, here's my best definition for wasted time: wasted time is time spent doing something less fulfilling, urgent, or enjoyable than what you could have done. Unfortunately, there isn't a single way to order activities in order of "worth," or even decide which activities are worth doing (in mathematical terms, this is a [partial ordering][partial-ordering]). We have to use our gut feeling and intuition for what activities are worth doing, and whether they'll make us happy in the short-term and long-term.


## How to Avoid Wasted Time

### Find Something (Fulfilling) to Do

Okay, so you decided to stop wasting your time, but what do you do now? Doing nothing is a decision, and the opportunity cost is not doing any kind of activity! How should you spend all that time you were using for Internet surfing? This is an important, but difficult question that only you can answer. 

That being said, I find that setting worthwhile goals and reaching them are good use of my time. Not only do you always have something interesting to work towards, in due time, you'll have something to show for your time and effort. My personal goals (at the time of writing this) are in learning machine learning and more math, but they're bound to change. Of course, my hope is that as I reach my sub-goals, I'll become wiser and get a better sense of what I'd like to study even further down the line. We all start somewhere, and in general, the earlier, the better.

Some good places to look for goals are your own personal experiences: 
* What do you enjoy talking with your friends and family about? 
* What are your interests?
* What gives you happiness even after days and weeks pass? What can you do to take this happiness even further into the future?
* What are your friends or family doing that seem interesting?
* Are there any clubs or school activities that seem interesting that you'd like to try out?
* Are there any things that you found cool and interesting, but you never had the motivation to start or didn't know how to start?

If these don't give you any good ideas, you might try asking your peers about how they're spending their time.

### Research Before Doing (Learn from Others' Mistakes)

By now, hopefully you've decided on an activity to further pursue or a new skill to learn, and you're eager to dive right in. But not so fast! Let's sharpen our axe before we start trying to chop down the tree with a dull axe.

Seek out resources (Internet, people around you, books) to learn **how** to further pursue your interests. Read other people's advice on the best way to get started or to develop your current interests. Learn from other people's mistakes and avoid making the same mistakes. You can get ahead simply by spending more time reading and listening to others than just trying to do stuff alone.

Although making mistakes on your own is an important part of the learning process, at all costs, you should avoid reinventing the wheel. If you plan to spend three months reading a textbook, you'd better spend enough time picking out the right book! All too often, we stop researching too early even though it is the most important part. 

Listen closely to the super smart people who figured out everything before you, and make sure to spend enough time researching before doing.
