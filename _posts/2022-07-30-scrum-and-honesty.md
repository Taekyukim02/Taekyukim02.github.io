I recently learned about Scrum at my summer internship at Realtime Robotics. To put it briefly, Scrum is a framework originating in software development designed to enable frequent communication between developers, customers, and product managers. Work is done in 1-4 week chunks called "Sprints" and the product manager is responsible for prioritizing the customers' wants and needs and assigning the developers the work to be done in the newest sprint. 

J. J. Sutherland, a co-creator of Scrum, wrote the book *Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time* that explains other concepts involved Scrum and why they can drastically boost productivity --- with real world examples of success brought by Scrum and failures by the traditional "waterfall" method. 

Today, I want to tell you about just one of the principles of Scrum: honesty. I'll explore this concept from several angles:
  1. Honesty in communication and feedback
  2. Honesty in productivity and reasonble work assignment

## Communication and Feedback



## Why Being Realistic is Important

J. J. Sutherland's book supports the idea that great work is created by happy, fulfilled workers who feel autonomy and pride in the work they are producing. To this point, if people are overworked and are pushed to work long hours with unreasonable work expectations, they will not feel satisfied by their work. Always, something will be left on the to-do list no matter how hard they seem to be working.

This was me in high school, and probably now as well. Always pushing myself to do more and more, too many things on my plate at the same time.
