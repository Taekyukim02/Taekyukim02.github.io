## PRIMES USA

I did math research at MIT PRIMES (USA section) under the mentorship of MIT graduate student Yongyi Chen. My project ``On Generalized Carmichael Numbers'' studied the following problem: for a given integer \\(k\\), what integers \\(n\\) satisfy \\(a^{n-k+1} \equiv a \pmod{n}\\) for all integers \\(a\\)?

My findings can be found on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04883).

## Euler Circle

### Research Group

During the summer of 2019, I was part of a research group at Euler Circle under the guidance of Dr. Rubinstein--Salzedo. Our goal was to find an efficient factoring algorithm for primes of specific forms, motivated by Pollard's \\(p-1\\), William's \\(p+1\\), and the more recent Cheng's \\(4p-1\\) algorithms. 

### Expository Papers

By the end of each Euler Circle class, students were expected to have studied and written a short expository paper on a topic related to, but not covered in the class. Below, I've attached a short description for each paper I wrote at Euler Circle.
